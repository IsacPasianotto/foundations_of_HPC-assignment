This repository contains the assignments for the exam of the course "Foundations of High Performance Computing" that I attended at the University of Trieste. 

There are 2 assignments, each one is in a different folder: 

- [Assignment 1](./assignment1): an implementation of the Conway's Game of Life in `C` using both MPI and OpenMP, according tho the specifications in the [assignment instructions](https://github.com/Foundations-of-HPC/Foundations_of_HPC_2022/blob/main/Assignment/exercise1/Assignment_exercise1.pdf).
