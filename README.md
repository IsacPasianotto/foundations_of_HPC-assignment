# Assignments for the course "Foundations of High Performance Computing" exam

This repository contains the assignments for the exam of the course "Foundations of High Performance Computing" that I attended at the University of Trieste (AY 2022-23). 

The assignment is composed of two exercises, each of them in its own folder: 

- [Assignment 1](./Assignment1): an implementation of the Conway's Game of Life in `C` parallelized with a hybrid approach (*MPI* + *OpenMP*) conformed to the requirements given in the [assignment instructions file](https://github.com/Foundations-of-HPC/Foundations_of_HPC_2022/blob/main/Assignment/exercise1/Assignment_exercise1.pdf).
- [Assignment 2](./Assignment2): a set of measurements made with the aim of evaluating how 3 math libraries, **openBLAS**, **MKL** and **BLIS**, perform executing a level 3 BLAS routine (`dgemm`) on the cluster I used for the course.


More information are available in the `README.md` files in each folder and in the report of the assignments uploaded in this repository.
